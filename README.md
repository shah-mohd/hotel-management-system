# Hotel Management System

In my project “Hotel Management System” I have tried to show how the data/information in hotels is managed. This is just an overview of management in hotels. It manages and maintains the records of customers, rooms, employees and drivers in the hotel. The project is aimed to maintain the day-to-day state of admission/vacation of Residents, List of employees, room details etc. Main objective of this project is to provide a solution for hotels to manage most their work using computerized processes.
This software application will help admin to handle customer information, room allocation details, Payment details etc.
